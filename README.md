SMART SOLAR STREETLIGHT & ACCIDENT DETECTION SYSTEM

Project Overview

This project is a Smart Solar-Powered Streetlight System with Accident Detection designed to improve urban safety and reduce energy consumption. It uses IoT sensors, renewable energy, and AI-based vision to provide adaptive lighting and emergency response in smart cities. The system automatically adjusts brightness based on environmental conditions and detects accidents using multiple sensors.

Problem Statement

Traditional streetlights waste energy by remaining ON even when roads are empty and lack real-time accident detection.

This results in:

High energy consumption,
Delayed emergency response,
Poor nighttime safety,
Our project addresses these problems using smart automation.

Solution

We developed an intelligent streetlight system that:

Uses solar energy for power,
Detects day/night automatically,
Adjusts brightness based on movement,
Detects accidents using sound and vibration,
Uses an AI camera for confirmation,
Activates emergency alerts,
This makes the system efficient, safe, and sustainable.

Key Features

Automatic Day/Night Detection,
Motion-Based Brightness Control,
Smooth Following Light Path,
Accident Detection (Sound + Vibration),
Emergency Mode Activation,
Solar-Powered Operation,
OLED Status Display,
Relay-Based Power Control,
AI-Based Accident Detection (ESP32-CAM),
Future GSM Alert Support.
